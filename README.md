# Javascript-Drumkit
Vanilla JS Challenge - Use the keyboard to play the drums.
Day 1 of a 30 day coding challenge to build 30 projest in 30 days (Javascript 30 courtesy of Wes Bos). 

In this project we built a drumkit so that when you press a button the browser makes a sound.

Used Javascript event listener ('click') to run a functon that played an associated HTML <audio> element and added a CSS class with a specified transition time upon the keydown event.

Used Javascript event listener ('transitionend') to run a functon which removed the previously added CSS class once the transition completed; giving the user a visual upon pressing a specific key.
